# 🚀 This project is part of Rocketseat's Ignite ReactNative track 🚀

### 💻 In this application we can create classes, and within the classes we can add participants at different times (TIME A and TEAM B)

➡️ In this application, the objective is to deepen basic concepts such as styled-components - we use styled components to create interface components, such as Header, Button, Input, Filter, Load, etc.

### Some libraries we use when building the application:

- react-navigation/native-stack -> to create stack navigation
- phosphor-react-native -> lib with icon packs for UI
- react-native-safe-area-context -> to place interface elements in device safe spaces
- styled-components -> to create interface components
- react-native-async-storage/async-storage -> to save data on the user's device
- babel/core -> to create file paths when imported
- typescript -> to create the typing of functions, variables, objects

### 💻 If you want to test the application on your machine, download this repository and run the 'npm run start' command with the Android Studio emulator open 🚀
